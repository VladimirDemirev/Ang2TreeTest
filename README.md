# Ang2TreeTest
Experiment with Angular Tree Component from https://angular2-tree.readme.io

## This test demonstrates:
- Angular 2+ compatible
- Typescript support
- to be able to have more than one component instances in same page
- to support filtering
- to support selection and multi-select
- to support Drag & Drop between the same tree and between multiple tree components
- CSS customization
- Custom icons at node level

*A NOTE*
the app does not pretend to be polished and dummy-friendly :) It just investigates the abilities of the component.
