# Ang2TreeTest
Experiment with Angular Tree Component from https://angular2-tree.readme.io

## This test demonstrates:

- tree display / populate from JSON
- show two trees in same page
- filter tree
- select node, muilti select
- drag drop between same tree / between two trees
- DRAG & DROP - single/multi node

? - show two custom icons on the RIGHT side (type icon, DEL button)

*A NOTE*
the app does not pretend to be polished and dummy-friendly :) It just investigates the abilities of the component.
